# Project README

Welcome to the GAECC project!

This project, GAECC (Genetic Algorithm for Error Correction Codes), is designed to find the optimal linear code block systematic matrix by leveraging the power of Genetic Algorithm. The goal is to minimize the bit error rate in a given channel.

## How it works

The Genetic Algorithm implemented in this project follows a population-based approach to evolve and optimize the code block systematic matrix. It starts with an initial population of candidate matrices and iteratively applies genetic operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation to generate new generations. The fitness of each candidate matrix is evaluated based on its performance in terms of the bit error rate.

## Getting started

To get started with the GAECC project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the GAECC folder.
3. Install the required dependencies.
4. Run the main script to start the Genetic Algorithm.
5. Monitor the progress and results.

## Contributing

Contributions to the GAECC project are welcome! If you have any ideas, bug fixes, or improvements, feel free to submit a pull request. Please make sure to follow the project's coding conventions and guidelines.

Happy coding!
